Please take this as confirmation that LibreNMS is authorising Paul Heinrichs of WaveDirect to be able to use the LibreNMS names, logos and other material to release an Android App called myLibreNMS.

LibreNMS is not a legally registered entity and no trademarks exist for the logo and or name. We are hoping that as this is published on the recognised website (www.librenms.org/mylibrenms.md) that it will be accepted as authorisation for Paul.

Kind Regards,

Neil Lathwood
LibreNMS
